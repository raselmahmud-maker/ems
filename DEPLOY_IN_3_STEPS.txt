  DEPLOY YOUR EMS APP – DO THESE 3 THINGS ONLY
================================================================================

I cannot create your accounts or click for you. You only need to do these 3 steps.
Each step is a few clicks and one copy-paste.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STEP 1 – Put your project on GitHub
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Upload was failing because "node_modules" folders are huge. Use one of these:

--------  OPTION A: Create a small folder, then upload (recommended)  --------

1. In File Explorer go to: C:\Users\farha\ems
2. Find the file: prepare-for-github-upload.ps1
3. RIGHT-CLICK it → "Run with PowerShell".
   (If a security warning appears, say Run / Yes.)
4. A new folder "ems-for-github" will open. It has your project WITHOUT node_modules.
5. Open https://github.com → Sign in → New repository → name: ems → Create repository.
6. On the new repo page, click "uploading an existing file".
7. Open the folder ems-for-github (inside C:\Users\farha\ems).
8. Select EVERYTHING inside ems-for-github (Ctrl+A), then drag it all into the GitHub
   upload area. Wait for upload to finish.
9. Scroll down, click "Commit changes".

Done. Your code is on GitHub.

--------  OPTION B: Use GitHub Desktop (no web upload)  --------

1. Download GitHub Desktop: https://desktop.github.com — install it.
2. Sign in with your GitHub account.
3. File → Add Local Repository → choose folder: C:\Users\farha\ems
4. It will say "this directory does not appear to be a Git repository". Click
   "create a repository" (or "create repository") and create it in that folder.
5. In the list of files, UNCHECK any "node_modules" so they are not included.
6. Write summary: "First commit", click "Commit to main".
7. Click "Publish repository" (or "Push origin"). Leave "Keep this code private"
   unchecked if you want Render to see it. Click Publish.

Done. Your code is on GitHub.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STEP 2 – Deploy on Render (about 3 minutes)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Open: https://render.com
2. Sign up (free) – you can "Sign up with GitHub".
3. Click "New +" at the top → choose "Blueprint".
4. Click "Connect account" to connect GitHub if asked.
5. Choose "Connect a repository" and select your "ems" repo.
6. Render will show one service (ems). Click "Apply".
7. Wait for the first deploy. It may fail the first time because we add env vars in Step 3. That’s OK.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STEP 3 – Add 3 environment variables on Render
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. In Render, open your "ems" service (click on it).
2. Click "Environment" in the left menu.
3. Click "Add Environment Variable" and add these THREE (one by one):

   Name:   MONGODB_URI
   Value:  [PASTE YOUR MONGODB ATLAS CONNECTION STRING HERE]
           You got this when you set up Atlas. It looks like:
           mongodb+srv://user:password@cluster0.xxxxx.mongodb.net/ems?retryWrites=true&w=majority

   Name:   JWT_SECRET
   Value:  9dbdffff51efa10aa449ae3429beeb96b5aa3c7b8cae4db26486821759ef58ae

   Name:   CLIENT_URL
   Value:  [Leave empty first. After deploy, copy your app URL from Render and put it here.]
           Example: https://ems-abc123.onrender.com (no slash at the end)

4. Click "Save Changes". Render will redeploy.

5. After deploy finishes, copy your service URL from the top of the page (e.g. https://ems-xxxx.onrender.com).
6. Go back to Environment, edit CLIENT_URL, paste that URL, Save again.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DONE – Open your app
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Open the URL (e.g. https://ems-xxxx.onrender.com) in your browser.
Log in with:  rasel@maam.sa  /  Farhan784

If the first deploy failed, after you add the 3 env vars and save, it will redeploy and work.
